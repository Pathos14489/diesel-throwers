    scene start_sun

    "I wake up as the sun's first light hits me through the open window."

    "A cursory glance at my clock does both the job of reminding me I have school, and that it's in an hour."

    "I sigh, popping my neck and sitting up in bed. I glance over at the clock at try to levitate it with my magic."

    "You twirl it in midair a little, nearly dropping it but keeping it aloft, albeit wobbly."

    scene start_sun_2

    show scoots chill at right

    "Filly" "Wow. You've gotten better."

    "I grin, happy with the results while glancing over to the voice."

    echo "Yah think?"

    show scoots grin

    "My room partner, an orange pegasus with purpley hair - I think I remember her name, Scootaloo? - smiles back with a tired grin."

    scoots "That's good. If anypony tries to beat you up, at least you won't die in the first round."

    show scoots chill

    "She yawns again."

    scoots "Well, I'm gonna grab the first shower. Don't go hunting for any panties while I'm out. Just because this was the only open room doesn't mean you can do whatever you want."

    echo "...Okay. So. Lets say I did do this. What would happen?"

    show scoots grin

    "She grins in an unsettling way."

    scoots "You know, there's a reason Ms. Heart was okay with you being in a filly's room. I've beat up more colts than anypony here."

    "She starts to walk out the door, but pauses."
    
    scoots "Unicorns, too."

    "She walks out."

    hide scoots grin

    echo "If you beat me up it'd be murder! I might, might have a chance with a newborn foal! But you?! Murder, I said!"

    show wh curious at right

    wh "Murder, you say?"

    "She gives you a curious look."

    echo "Murder I said.

    echo "I said murder."

    wh "I see."

    show wh skeptical

    "She smiles bemusedly."

    wh "If you're talking about that breath of yours, I certainly agree. Make sure to brush up a little extra after breakfast, 'kay?"

    echo "Okay."

    "I shrug, yawning and hopping out of bed."

    show wh curious

    wh "How are you liking it here, by the way? Scootaloo hasn't been too hard on you, has she?"

    "I shrug."

    echo "I mean yeah. And she's cool, she only threatens to strangle me sometimes."

    "She nods."

    wh "Good. I'm glad you're getting along."

    show wh skeptical

    "She smirks."

    wh "I wouldn't get too friendly, though. She'll castrate you."

    "I blush lightly." 
    
    echo "Yeah. Probably. Absolutely."

    "She nods, then walks out." 
    
    wh "I'd hurry downstairs if you want breakfast,"
    
    hide wh

    wh "Chops just woke up!"

    "I nod slowly."
    
    echo "...Chops. The uh... Yeah I know... him."

    show wh skeptical

    "She comes back, a bemused expression on her face."
    
    wh "It's your second day, I don't think you've met her quite yet."

    "I scratch my head."
    
    echo "Right. Wanna introduce me?"

    wh "You'll find out in a way you won't like if you don't hurry downstairs." 
    
    hide wh

    "She continues on down the hall, knocking on doors and calling for others to wake up."

    echo "Okkie dokie."
    
    "I glance around, it's a pretty okay room. Blue walls, with a light-blue ceiling. I find that there are several folded paper cranes hanging from the ceiling. Across the room, on Scootaloo's side, there are posters of a mare with a rainbow-colored mane, dashing through the sky. I think I see a small something with a similar rainbow pattern peeking from the edge of her tangled sheets, but I'm not sure."

    "I give it a curious glance before shrugging. Then a thought hit me."

    echo "...Scootaloo has clothes? Isn't that a kink thing for rich ponies??"

    "Do I dare to see what the rainbow object is?"
    "Add a choice here later"

    "I glance back at it, sweating slightly and eyeing the door. Before bolting out of the room before curiousity came and bit me in the ass. Or worse, Scootaloo came and kicked me in the ass."

    "I'm on the balcony, overlooking a busy living room. Several ponies are down there, munching on something or another as they pack up for school."

    "I glance around, hurrying downstairs."

    "I see to my right a kitchen, the busiest center. On my left is the living room, and in front of me is the door. Ponies leave every now and then as they finish getting ready, it seems I can just go whenever I'M ready."

    "I search around for Ms. Heart, she's nowhere to be seen."

    "Somepony" "Uh-oh! Chops is coming, everypony get food, fast!"

    "I glance around, confused as fuck and having no idea where this mythical \"food\" these ponies talked of might be. My search takes me to the kitchen and I find a table that showed to have once been full of fresh foods and veggies, but I'm left with the choice between oranges and grapes for fruit, and celery for a veggie. There's bread somewhere, a half loaf."

    "I find an opening in the crowd, letting I pass to get to the table quickly and I grab as many oranges as I can carry. Being one orange."

    "You find yourself being softly nudged. A little rose-colored filly with a darker red mane timidly noses a paper bag to you."

    "Rose-colored Filly" "Here's a bag..."

    "She whispers, hiding herself behind her long mane."

    echo "Thanks."

    "I smile. I say after dropping the orange in the bag and taking it. I add another orange to it. She smiles a little, then vanishes with a pop. I stare at where she was with an incredibly wide and awkward smile. My eye twitchs as I glance at the bag in my mouth, then back to where she was. I inch backwards a step."

    echo "...Ehhh... ghoost... pony... little... filly..."

    "I mumble, inching back, and then inching back again."

    "Somepony behind you chuckles."

    "Griffin" "That's Rosepop. At least, that's what everypony calls her. She's a unicorn, and she's an expert at teleportation even though she's really young." 
    
    "A beaked face walks into your range of sight, up to the table."
   
    chops "Hi! I'm Chops."
